# ReactJS Frontend with Authentication System

This repository contains a fundamental implementation of a ReactJS frontend that includes a fully functional authentication system. It supports user sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out, along with persistent authentication using tokens and cookies. The current setup features a home page and a dashboard, providing a solid foundation for expanding the application to accommodate more complex features.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and logout flows.
- **Persistent Authentication**: Sessions remain active even after refreshing or closing the browser.
- **Extensible Structure**: The project is structured to easily integrate additional features like user roles, profile management, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: v18.3.1 – A powerful library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: v3.4.14 – A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
